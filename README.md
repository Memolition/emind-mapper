# eMind Mapper
Client-based JS Mind Mapping tool.

This is a work-in-progress project just started back on 3.15.2019

The idea is to develop an online "serverless" Project Management platform integrating some of latest existing APIs including:
* Social networking (Mainly for session stuff)
  * Google Identity (OAuth)
  * Microsoft Graph (Onedrive session)
  * Linkedin
  * Facebook
  * Twitter
* Storage
  * Google Drive
  * Onedrive
  * Dropbox
* Team contribution
  * Slack
  * Asana
  * Trello
* Code
  * Github
  * Gitlab
  * Bitbucket

# TODO:
* Import/Export database
* Connect to Google Drive
  * Save IndexedDB
* #Asana integration
  * In eMind mark `Ideas` as `Tasks` and sync them to Asana as `Tasks`
  * Sync `Tasks` using `Asana API Stories`
* Github, Gitlab integration
  * In eMind mark `Ideas` as `Code Tasks` and sync them as `Git Issues`
  * Sync `Git issues and commits` history when loading eMind project
* Team Foundation integration
